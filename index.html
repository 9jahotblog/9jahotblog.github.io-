    <div class="w3-container">
      <p> Following the host of the Oscars award 2022 by the 94th Academy Awards. American actor "Will Smith" hit Chris rock due to the mockery of the shaved hair of Will's wife "Jade Pinkett Smith" will was angered by this expensive joke of Chris
Who said... <p style="color:#0000FF">"Jada I love you, GI Jane 2 can't wait to see you"</p> Referring to Jada's shaved head. G.I. Jane is a 1997 American film starring Demi Moore (Charliesâ€™ Angels: Full Throttle, General Hospital), which tells the fictional story of the first woman to go through special operations training, similar to that of the U.S Navy SEALs.
 Jada has Alopecia A medical term for loss of hair. 
Will in his PR wrote he can't joke about his wife medical's condition, this triggered him standing up to slap Chris & headed back to his seat.
Echoing <p style="color:#0000FF">"Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth"</p>twice. The laughing crowd became silent including Chris rock who was laughing at first.
Chris silently whispered <p style="color:#0000FF">This is the greatest night in the history of television..</p>

      <h3><b>Kevin Owens Impersonates Stone Cold</b></h3>
 Â  Â  Â <h5> [WrestleMania] Kevin Pisses Stone Cold off after loosing to Riddle & Randy Orton. KO VS STONE COLD AT WRESTLEMANIA. <span class="w3-opacity">March 21st, 2022</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p> Kevin Owens & Seth Freakin Rollins lost their match against Riddle & Randy Orton. The winner was said to be eligible for this year's WrestleMania. 
Since KO & Seth lost it was a devastating moment for them. Riddle used the opportunity of Seth & KO at the end of the match, it was a triple threat. {Ko & Rollins}, {Riddle & Randy}, {Shorty G & Otis}.
KO had gave RKO to Shorty & Seth had included "burn it down", at the moment of counting.... Riddle flipped Rollins outta the ring & took the win. 
KO had to get another opportunity to go to WrestleMania so he thought Stone Cold was the best way. Ko said.. 
<p style="color:#0000FF">"There's nobody like me, and Steve Austin obviously knows that," said Owens. "Or maybe it's this unreasonable pride that he's got for Texas. My history with Texas really struck a chord with him. But Steve and I have a lot of history actually. I met him at an airport in 2005 when I was an independent wrestler just trying to make my way. I remember asking him for advice and he gave me a piece of advice that changed the entire trajectory of my career. Years later, I was on his podcast. Some years later, I asked him if he'd be okay with me using the Stunner. He was more than happy to tell me I could, to give me his blessing. So there's a lot of history there and I think it's unfortunate that my issues with Texas seem to have rubbed him the wrong way. But the important part is that he accepted my invitation."</p>
